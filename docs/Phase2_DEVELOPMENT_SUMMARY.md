## Debugging Process and Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: IDF Calculation Zero Values
**Problem Identified:**
- All document relevance scores were 0.0
- IDF values calculated as `log(total_docs / doc_frequency)` resulted in 0 when only 1 document existed
- This caused all scores to be filtered out by the score threshold

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Created debug program to trace score calculation
2. Found IDF = 0.0 for single-document corpora
3. Score calculation: `TF * IDF * query_weight = 1.0 * 0.0 * log(2) = 0.0`

**Solution Implemented:**
- Applied IDF smoothing formula: `log((total_docs + 1) / doc_frequency) + 1.0`
- This ensures non-zero IDF values even in small corpora
- Standard information retrieval technique for handling small document collections

**Impact:**
- Fixed score normalization tests
- Resolved index optimization failures
- Corrected thread safety test issues
- Improved from 84→87 passing tests

### Issue 2: Query Processing Inconsistency
**Problem Identified:**
- Batch operations were failing with empty results
- Individual queries like "apples", "bananas", "oranges" returned no documents
- Documents were indexed with stemming but queries were processed without stemming

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Document indexing used `text_processor_->process()` (includes stemming)
2. Query processing used `text_processor_->tokenize()` (no stemming)
3. Result: Documents indexed as "apple" but queries searched for "apples"

**Debug Process:**
```cpp
// Document tokens after processing: ['apple', 'fruit']
// Query tokens after tokenization: ['apples']
// No matches found!
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `process_query()` method to use `text_processor_->process()` instead of `tokenize()`
- Ensured consistent text processing pipeline for both documents and queries
- Applied stemming, stop word removal, and normalization to queries

**Impact:**
- Fixed batch operations completely
- Resolved query-document matching issues
- Improved from 87→88 passing tests

### Issue 3: Token Length Constraints
**Problem Identified:**
- "Very long document" edge case test was failing
- Document with 30 'a' characters returned no results when queried
- Single-character queries like "a" were being filtered out

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Document content: `"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"` (30 chars)
2. Text processor configuration: `max_token_length = 20`
3. Document was filtered out for exceeding token length limits
4. Query "a" was filtered out for being below `min_token_length = 2`

**Debug Process:**
```cpp
// Long document tokens: [] (filtered out - length 30 > max 20)
// Short document tokens: ['aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'] (length 15, within limits)
// Query "a" tokens: [] (filtered out - length 1 < min 2)
```

**Solution Implemented:**
- Increased `max_token_length` from 20 to 50 in retrieval processor
- More reasonable limit for practical document processing
- Maintained performance while accommodating longer tokens

**Impact:**
- Fixed edge case handling for long documents
- Improved token length flexibility
- Achieved final 88→89 passing tests

## Technical Architectural Decisions
